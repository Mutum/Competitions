A) Prerequisites

Ensure that the following packages are installed:
dplyr, tidy, xgboost, tm, SnowBallC, readr, qdap, stringr, stylo, caret

B) Build Submission File

1) Ensure that all datasets i.e. Student, Internships, train and test are 
present in the "data" folder. Download from the link in the description of this repository
2) Execute the RScript "BUILD_FINAL_SUBMISSION.R"
3) Wait for some time to complete
4) Check the "Submissions" folder for the FINAL Submission file

C) Improvements

1) I couldn't try other models for lack of time. Building other models might also be helpful
2) I have build a long list of features but I haven't removed the unnecessary files. Feature Selection would have us reduce the feature Sets
