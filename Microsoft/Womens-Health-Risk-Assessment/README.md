The objective of this machine learning competition is to build machine learning models to assign a young woman subject (15-30 years old) in one of the 9 underdeveloped regions into a risk segment, and a subgroup within the segment. 
After the accurate assignments of the risk segment and subgroup in each region, a healthcare practitioner can deliver services to prevent the subject from the health risks, specifically sexual and reproductive health risks (like HIV infections). The types of services are personalized, based on the risk segment and subgroup assignments.
